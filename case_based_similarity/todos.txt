TODOs as of 01.12.19
* Include multi-gpu-usage for cbs
    * In a way that each case base handler uses one
    * Ensure these work parallel
* Fix real time classification
    * Preprocessing must be changed in the same way like the data generation was
    * Adaptation to new type of return values
* Work through the other inline todos including small fixes
* General optimisation and testing with new datasets

Future features:
* Change the way how it is checked whether an ffnn
* Add continue training for cbs
    * Stopping at goal loss must be considered
* Use individual hyper parameters for each case_handler
    * Maybe add goal loss here?
* Change loading of CaseSpecificDataset
    * Load a FullDataset in CBS
    * Create CaseSpecificDatasets with that one instead of reloading from files every time
    * Remember to create copys and dont use references because of possible encoding
* Use os.path.join for all operation, including config
* Change LSTM back to .LSTM from .RNN
    * Only faster if error can be fixed
