TODOs as of 11.10

* Remove .astype('float32') wherever possible
* Fix SNNs
    * Check if inference is working correctly
    * Remove if test from draw pair, because this is never used
* Encoding for fast version of cbs
    * Way of encoding must be changed in comparison to the one for snns
      because it can't be safed in single file if the same feature is used for multiple cases
    * Add method to dataset for encoding it after it was loaded, one parameter is the encoder that should be used
    * Adapt this version for the snn
* Implement the other case handler classes, which use FFNNs and or encoding at startup (fast...)
* Fix real time classification
    * Preprocessing must be changed in the same way like the data generation was
    * Adaptation to new type of return values
* Work through the other inline todos including small fixes
* General optimisation and testing with new datasets

Future features:
* Include multi-gpu-usage for cbs
    * In a way that each case base handler uses one
    * Ensure these work parallel
* Use individual hyper parameters for each case_handler
* Change loading of CaseSpecificDataset
    * Load a FullDataset in CBS
    * Create CaseSpecificDatasets with that one instead of reloading from files every time
* Use os.path.join for all operation, including config
* Store configuration when saving models
    * Those configs that are must match safed model
        * e.g. used cases
